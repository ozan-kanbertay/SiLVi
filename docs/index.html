        First, upload the files for actions and individuals <a href="#help-file-format">in the required format</a>. After you upload a file, a keyboard shortcut will be generated automatically for each item in the file. You can also change these shortcuts later.

        <div id="help-enable-labeling" class="mt-3 fw-bold help-subitem">Enable labeling</div>
        <p>
        To start recording behaviors with keyboard shortcuts, first enable the labeling mode. You can do this either by toggling the relevant button on the main view panel or by pressing the assigned shortcut. 
        </p>
        <video src="./videos/labeling_mode_toggle.mp4" class="border rounded shadow help-video" muted loop></video>
        <p>
        When you are typing, the labeling is disabled automatically to prevent any clashes with the shortcuts.

        <div id="help-record-behaviors" class="fw-bold help-subitem">Record Behaviors</div>
        <p>
        Each observation of a behavior consists of a subject, an action and optionally a target.
        <p>
        The frame in which you press the shortcut for a subject will be recorded as the start frame. Similarly, the frame in which you press the shortcut assigned to a target or ending an observation without a target will be recorded as the end frame.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are three ways to record a behavior.
        </p>
        <div class="fw-bold">1. Behaviors with a target</div>
        <ul>
        <li>Go to the start frame of the behavior</li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to the subject of the behavior</li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to the action of the behavior</li>
        <li>Go to the end frame of the behavior </li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to the target of the behavior (either a box or one of the individuals)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="fw-bold">2. Behaviors without a target</div>
        <p>
        There are two ways to record a behavior without a target.
        </p>
        <div class="fw-bold">2.1. Single behavior without a target</div>
        <ul>
        <li>Go to the start frame of the behavior </li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to the subject of the behavior </li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to the action of the behavior</li>
        <li>Go to the end frame of the behavior</li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to ending the current observation</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="fw-bold">2.2. Consecutive behaviors with the same subject</div>
        <ul>
        <li>Go to the start frame of the first behavior</li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to the subject of the first behavior</li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to the action of the first behavior</li>
        <li>Go to the end frame of the first behavior (this will also be the start frame of the second behavior)</li>
        <li>Press the shortcut assigned to the action of the next behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The first behavior will be recorded without a target.
        </p>
        <p>
        The frame in which you pressed the shortcut for the second action will be recorded as the end frame of the first behavior. This frame will also be recorded as the start frame of the second behavior. Now, the app will wait for you to select a target for the second observation or ending the observation without a target. You should then go to the frame where the second behavior ends and press the shortcut assigned to your selection for the target.

        <p>
        You can zoom into a specific region of the main view.
        </p>
        <p>
        First, enable the zoom mode. Then, hold down your mouse over the main view and draw a rectangle to zoom in on a specific area. Release the mouse to view the zoomed area in a new window.

        <h5>Save Your Work</h5>
        <p>
        Your observations, tracking edits and notes linked to the main view are always saved automatically.
        </p> 
        <p>
        When you open a new video as the main view with any previous work linked to it, the app will import them. For example, you were working on Video A, then opened Video B before completing your work on the Video A. You worked a bit on Video B, then resumed your work on Video A. All your work linked to Video A (behaviors, tracking edits, notes, etc.) will be automatically reimported. This is also true when you reopen the Video B.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can export all files linked to the main view whenever you prefer. The files will be exported into a folder named after the main view. The app will keep your work even after you export these files.

    <div id="help-file-format" class="help-item">
        <h5>File Formats</h5>
        <p>
        To start labeling behaviors, text files for action types, modifiers and individual names must be uploaded first. Each item in these files must be separated with a comma. For consistency, please do not put a space within an item. For example, if an item in the action list describes a "successful push", write down either "successful_push" or "SuccessfulPush". Other than this, there is no restriction on the names.
        </p>

    <div id="help-clear-app-data" class="help-item">
        <h5>Clear App Data</h5>
        <p>
        If necessary, you can clear the app data via the <em>Settings</em> menu. This can be useful as a last resort solution if you encounter any issues that cannot be resolved by any other way. However, <strong>clearing the app data will result in losing all unexported work</strong>. Please export your work before using this option.
