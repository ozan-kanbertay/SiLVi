# Labeling Interactions

You can record your observation either by [interacting with bounding boxes]({% link labeling_interactions/label_with_bounding_boxes.md %}) or by [using keyboard shortcuts]({% link labeling_interactions/label_with_hotkeys.md %}).

To record your observations by interacting with bounding boxes, you should either import a tracking file or draw bounding boxes around the subjects of interest.

To utilize keyboard shortcut, you should first upload files for actions and individuals in the [required format]({% link file_formats.md %}). After you upload a file, a keyboard shortcut will be generated automatically for each item in the file. You can also change these shortcuts later.
