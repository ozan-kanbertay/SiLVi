# Labeling with Keyboard Shortcuts

First, make sure to upload files for actions and individuals in the [required format]({% link file_formats.md %}).

After you upload a file, a keyboard shortcut will be generated automatically for each item in the file. You can also change these shortcuts later.

To start recording behaviors with keyboard shortcuts, first enable the labeling mode. You can do this either by toggling the relevant button on the main view panel or by pressing the assigned shortcut.

When you are typing, the labeling is disabled automatically to prevent any clashes with the shortcuts.

Each observation of a behavior consists of a subject, an action and optionally a target.

The frame in which you press the shortcut for a subject will be recorded as the start frame. Similarly, the frame in which you press the shortcut assigned to a target or ending an observation without a target will be recorded as the end frame.

There are three ways to record a behavior.

## 1. Behaviors with a target
- Go to the start frame of the behavior
- Press the shortcut assigned to the subject of the behavior
- Press the shortcut assigned to the action of the behavior
- Go to the end frame of the behavior 
- Press the shortcut assigned to the target of the behavior (either a box or one of the individuals)

## 2. Behaviors without a target
There are two ways to record a behavior without a target.

### 2.1. Single behavior without a target
- Go to the start frame of the behavior 
- Press the shortcut assigned to the subject of the behavior 
- Press the shortcut assigned to the action of the behavior
- Go to the end frame of the behavior
- Press the shortcut assigned to ending the current observation


### 2.2. Consecutive behaviors with the same subject
- Go to the start frame of the first behavior
- Press the shortcut assigned to the subject of the first behavior
- Press the shortcut assigned to the action of the first behavior
- Go to the end frame of the first behavior (this will also be the start frame of the second behavior)
- Press the shortcut assigned to the action of the next behavior

The first behavior will be recorded without a target.

The frame in which you pressed the shortcut for the second action will be recorded as the end frame of the first behavior. This frame will also be recorded as the start frame of the second behavior. Now, the app will wait for you to select a target for the second observation or ending the observation without a target. You should then go to the frame where the second behavior ends and press the shortcut assigned to your selection for the target.
