## Clearing App Data
If necessary, you can clear the app data via the <em>Settings</em> menu. This can be useful as a last resort solution if you encounter any issues that cannot be resolved by any other way. However, <strong>clearing the app data will result in losing all unexported work</strong>. Please export your work before using this option.
