    "content": "To create spatially localized annotations of interactions, a tracking file for the main video can be imported into the app. The tracking file should either be in simplified or extended MOT Challenge format1. The simplified format consists of a text file with one line per detection containing frame number, object ID, bounding box coordinates (with the top left corner of the bounding box, width and height), detection confidence and object class. Alternatively, the extended format additionally includes individual ID and confidence. Such a tracking file can be obtained by processing a video with a multi-animal tracking model such as PriMAT2. Animal detection and tracking are currently not performed by SILVI but are assumed to be a separate pre-processing step. | MOTChallenge: A Benchmark for Single-Camera Multiple Target Tracking &#8617; . | PriMAT: A robust multi-animal tracking model for primates in the wild &#8617; . | .

    "content": "SILVI (Simple Interface for Labelling Video Interactions) is a lightweight, open-source tool designed specifically to facilitate the annotation of interactions in a way that is both spatially and temporally localized, enabling the generation of training data for computer vision models. By supporting precise annotations of both actions and interactions across individuals, SILVI empowers researchers to move beyond individual-centric behavioral models toward richer representations of social behavior. Apart from this main contribution, SILVI also allows for labeling individual IDs and annotating or correcting tracks. You can read our preprint here. If you use SILVI in your research, please cite it. ",
