# Saving Your Work

Your observations, tracking edits and notes linked to the main view are always saved automatically.

When you open a new video as the main view with any previous work linked to it, the app will import them. For example, you were working on Video A, then opened Video B before completing your work on the Video A. You worked a bit on Video B, then resumed your work on Video A. All your work linked to Video A (behaviors, tracking edits, notes, etc.) will be automatically reimported. This is also true when you reopen the Video B.

You can export all files linked to the main view whenever you prefer. The files will be exported into a folder named after the main view. The app will keep your work even after you export these files.
